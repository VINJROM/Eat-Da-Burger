### Burger.js ###

# Description #
This application was built using technologies including Handlebars, Express, Node, ORM, and SQL Databases. Inside the application, users type the name of a burger they would like to eat, which adds the respective value to a SQL database and displays it on the webpage. After clicking "Devour it" the database will be deleted and reflected properly on the webpage.

# Motivation #
This application is part of the University of Minnesota's Web Application Development program. This particular assignment challenged students to apply their Handlebars, Node, MySQL, and ORM skills.

# Result #
The result is database-interactive webpage that allows users to keep create, modify, and delete entries.
